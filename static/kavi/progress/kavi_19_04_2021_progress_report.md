# Progress report 19/04/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Got CUDA working on the BU server 

- Created a testing framework for exploring augmentation methods on different sized datasets 

- Trained the Glow-TTS model on both the unaugmented and augmented datasets of different sizes and looked at how the loss converges. 

- Synthesised some speech using both models to compare how they sound subjectively, and created a Jupyter notebook to compare them side by side. There doesn't seem to be any improvement when augmenting the dataset, regardless of size. I've attached a more detailed report.

- Built a simple [github-pages site](https://intel-pa.github.io/) that can be integrated with Teams to quickly browse relevant material. Team members can update the site by pushing to the Intel-PA.github.io repository. It's quite hacky and needs to be improved, but I think it helps to centralise all the documents that we'd be generating over the course of this work. Would also save having to type in lots of emails for these progress updates!

- Completed Week 3 of the Coursera Deep Learning specialisation (3/4 of the way through completing the 1st course in the specialisation)


## What I'll do next:

- Continue with Coursera

- Keep investigating whether there are any better augmentation alternatives to frequency/time masking

- Integrate the Glow-TTS module with the rest of the chatbot codebase

- Start working on the proposal for my initial review in June

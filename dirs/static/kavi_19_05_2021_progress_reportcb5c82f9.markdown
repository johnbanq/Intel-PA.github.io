# Progress report - 19/05/2021 - Kavi

## What I've done

- Wrote a first draft of my probationary review document
- Contacted NHSX about getting access to medical datasets on 06/05, no reply yet
- Created a shell script to make pushing to the Intel-PA site easier
- Ran more training iterations on the augmented speech dataset, but ran into some VRAM problems on the remote machine - had to scale down mini-batch size to 1, and this seems to cause issues with training. The loss will plateau for a while and eventually start increasing instead of decreasing.
- Finished week 2/3 of the second Coursera course

## What I'll do next

- Make amendments to my probationary review document after reviewing it with Prof. Southern 
- Continue with Coursera
